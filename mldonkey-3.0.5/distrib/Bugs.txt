If you think your bug is a very important one, and nobody has fixed it in a
long time, it might be that we don't have enough information to reproduce it
and understand it. So, what you can do to help us is to call the
"make_buginfo" utility provided with mldonkey, which creates a file
buginfo.tar.gz . Send this file directly to the developers
(buginfo@mldonkey.net), as it might contain your IP address and you probably
don't want to publish this file on the bug tracker web site.

(** Association tables over ordered types.

   This module implements applicative association tables, also known as
   finite maps or dictionaries, given a total ordering function
   over the keys.
   All operations over maps are purely applicative (no side-effects).
   The implementation uses balanced binary trees, and therefore searching
   and insertion take time logarithmic in the size of the map. 
*)

type key = int
(** The type of the map keys. *)

type (+'a) t
(** The type of maps from type [key] to type ['a]. *)

val empty: 'a t
(** The empty map. *)

val add: key -> 'a -> 'a t -> 'a t
(** [add x y m] returns a map containing the same bindings as
       [m], plus a binding of [x] to [y]. If [x] was already bound
       in [m], its previous binding disappears. *)

val find: key -> 'a t -> 'a
(** [find x m] returns the current binding of [x] in [m],
       or raises [Not_found] if no such binding exists. *)

val remove: key -> 'a t -> 'a t
(** [remove x m] returns a map containing the same bindings as
       [m], except for [x] which is unbound in the returned map. *)

val mem: key -> 'a t -> bool
(** [mem x m] returns [true] if [m] contains a binding for [x],
       and [false] otherwise. *)

val iter: (key -> 'a -> unit) -> 'a t -> unit
(** [iter f m] applies [f] to all bindings in map [m].
       [f] receives the key as first argument, and the associated value
       as second argument. The order in which the bindings are passed to
       [f] is unspecified. Only current bindings are presented to [f]:
       bindings hidden by more recent bindings are not passed to [f]. *)

val map: ('a -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b t
(** [map f m] returns a map with same domain as [m], where the
       associated value [a] of all bindings of [m] has been
       replaced by the result of the application of [f] to [a].
       The order in which the associated values are passed to [f]
       is unspecified. *)

val mapi: (key -> 'a -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b t
(** Same as {!Map.S.map}, but the function receives as arguments both the
       key and the associated value for each binding of the map. *)

val fold: (key -> 'a -> 'b -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b -> 'b
(** [fold f m a] computes [(f kN dN ... (f k1 d1 a)...)],
       where [k1 ... kN] are the keys of all bindings in [m],
       and [d1 ... dN] are the associated data.
       The order in which the bindings are presented to [f] is
       unspecified. *)

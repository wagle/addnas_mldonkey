0.  Foreward

This is meant to be an open specification.  If you find errors or know of
additional functionality not described hereafter, please send me email.  It
benefits the entire community to have a complete and accurate protocol
specification.  Not only does it allow for clients to be developed for any
platform, but also decreases the strain on the server having to parse out
bad client messages.

Disclaimer: The following information was gathered by analyzing the protocol
between the linux nap client and may not resemble the official Windows client
protocol.

1.  Recent Changes

* Section 3: 430-432 channel invite messages (2001-04-07)
* Section 3: WMA-FILE used as checksum for .wma files (2001-03-12)
* numeric 607 adds download client's speed (2000-12-28)
* added new numerics 640-642 for direct client to client browsing support
  (2000-12-23)

2.  Client-Server protocol

Napster uses TCP for client to server communication.  Typically the servers
run on ports 8888 and 7777.  Note that this is different from the `metaserver'
(or redirector) which runs on port 8875.

each message to/from the server is in the form of
	<length><type><data>
where <length> and <type> are 2 bytes each.  <length> specifies the length in
bytes of the <data> portion of the message.  Be aware that <length> and <type>
appear to be in little-endian format (least significant byte goes first).  For
example, in the C language you would encode the number 1 as
	const unsigned char num[2] = { 0x01, 0x00 };
and 256 would be encoded as
	const unsigned char num[2] = { 0x00, 0x01 };
[The above is for illustrative purposes only, there are much quicker ways to
actually encode a number. -ed]
The <data> portion of the message is a plain ASCII string.

Note that in many cases, strings are passed as double-quoted entries.  For
example, filenames and client id strings are always sent as
	"random band - generic cowboy song.mp3"
or
	"nap v0.8"
Where required, double quotes are used in the description of the messages
below.

Some additional information about use of quotes inside of quotes:
> The answer is, no, it doesn't do escaping of quotes.  If you try searching
> for the phrase 'a "quoted" string' on the windows client, you get no songs
> found, and "invalid search request" printed in yellow in your console
> window.  (don't know what code that is, sorry.)
>
> and no wonder-- a little birdie told me that the client sends this:
>
> FILENAME CONTAINS "a "quoted" string" MAX_RESULTS 100

Note that unlike the IRC protocol, each line does NOT end in \r\n.  The
<length> field specifies exactly how much data you should read.

3.  Message Types

The following section describes the format of the <data> section for each
specific message type.  Each field is denoted with <>.  The fields in a
message are separated by a single space character (ASCII 32).  Where
appropriate, examples of the <data> section for each message are given.

<type> can be one of the following (converted to big-endian):

0	error message [SERVER]

	Format: <message>

2	login [CLIENT]

	Format: <nick> <password> <port> "<client-info>" <link-type> [ <num> ]

	<port> is the port the client is listening on for data transfer.  if
		this value is 0, it means that the client is behind a firewall
		and can only push files outward.  it is expected that requests
		for downloads be made using the 500 message (see below)
	<client-info> is a string containing the client version info
	<link-type> is an integer indicating the client's bandwidth
		0  unknown
		1  14.4 kbps
		2  28.8 kpbs
		3  33.6 kbps
		4  56.7 kbps
		5  64K ISDN
		6  128K ISDN
		7  Cable
		8  DSL
		9  T1
		10 T3 or greater
	<num> build number for the windows client [optional]
		
	Example:

	foo badpass 6699 "nap v0.8" 3

3	login ack [SERVER]

	Format: <email>

	the server sends this message to the client after a succesful
	login (2).  If the nick is registered, the <email> address given at
	registration time is returned.  If the nick is not registered, a
	dummy value is returned.

4       version check [CLIENT]

        Format: <version>

	Server sends [5] if an update is needed. All other responses are
	ignored.

	<version> = string, version 2.0b5a sends "2.0"

5       "auto-upgrade" [SERVER]

        Format: <version> <hostname:filename>

        Napster is out of date, get a new version.
        Or also known as gaping security hole.

        <version>  = string, the new version number.
        <hostname> = string, hostname of upgrade (http) server
        <filename> = string, filename

        Connections are always made to port 80.

        The HTTP Request:
                GET <filename> HTTP/1.0
                Connection: Keep-Alive
                Host: <hostname>

        Expected HTTP Response.
                Content-Length: <size>
                Content-Type: <doesn't matter>
                <data>

        Upgrade file is save as "upgrade.exe".
        And executed as: upgrade.exe UPGRADE "<current.exe>"

        As far as I can tell no confirmation is requested by Napster when it
        receives this message.  And immediately start to "auto-upgrade". To keep
        users informed that Napster is doing something potentially very harmful
        to their computer it displays a message saying it's "auto-upgrading".

        I think this pretty bad, since all someone has to do is hack a napster
        server et voila a zillion clients at your disposal.

        As far as I known this only affects the Win32 2.0b5a Napster client.
        Other clients/versions I don't know.

6	new user login [CLIENT]

	Format: <nick> <pass> <port> "<client-info>" <speed> <email-address>

	This message is used when logging in for the first time to register
	a new nickname.  The client normally checks for an unused nick using
	the "check nickname" (7) message and upon receipt of a "nickname not
	registered" (8) from the server will proceceed to log in with this
	command.

	note: this message is similar to the 0x02 message, with the addition	
	of <email-address> on the end

	Example:

	foo foo 6699 "nap v0.8" 3 email@here.com

7	nick check [CLIENT]

	Format: <nick>

	Queries the server to see if <nick> is already registered.  This
	message is typically used prior to logging in for the first time to
	check for a valid nickname.

	Response to this message is one of 8, 9 or 10

8	nickname not registered [SERVER]

	Format: (empty)

	The server sends this message in response to the "nick check" (7)
	message to indicate that the specified nickname is not already
	registered and is ok to use.

9	nickname already registered [SERVER]

	Format: (empty)

	The server sends this message when the nickname the client has
	requested has already been registered by another user

10 (0x0a)	invalid nickname [SERVER]

	Format: (empty)

	This server sends this message in response to the "check nickname"
	(7) messages when the specified nickname is invalid, usually due to
	bad characters such as spaces or other non-printable characters.

        The Napster, Inc. servers only accept (upper- and lower-case) nicks
        comprised of the following:
               abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890_[]{}-@^!$

11	??? [CLIENT]

	Format: <nick> <pass>

	[returns "parameters are unparsable" -ed]

12	??? [SERVER]

	Format: (empty)

	this message is returned in response to message 11 from the client

13	echo??? [SERVER]

	Format: <numeric>: [args]

	Prior to issuing a login (2) command, the server will echo back the
	received numeric and any arguments of any commands it receives.

14	login options [CLIENT]

	NAME:%s ADDRESS:%s CITY:%s STATE:%s PHONE:%s AGE:%s INCOME:%s EDUCATION:%s

	Example:

	NAME: kev  ADDRESS:  CITY: ephrata  STATE: pa  PHONE:  AGE: 60 or older INCOME: $100,000 or more        EDUCATION: Graduate Degree

100 (0x64)	client notification of shared file [CLIENT]

	Format: "<filename>" <md5> <size> <bitrate> <frequency> <time>

	<md5> see section "MD5"
	<size> is bytes
	<bitrate> is kbps
	<frequency> is hz
	<time> is seconds
	
	Example:

	"generic band - generic song.mp3" b92870e0d41bc8e698cf2f0a1ddfeac7 443332 128 44100 60

102 (0x66)	remove file [CLIENT]

	Format: <filename>

	client requests to remove file from shared library

110		unshare all files [CLIENT]

	Format: (empty)

	Notifies the server that the client is no longer sharing any of the
	files previously shared.

200 (0xc8)	client search request [CLIENT]

    [FILENAME CONTAINS "artist name"] MAX_RESULTS <max> [FILENAME CONTAINS
"song"] [LINESPEED <compare> <link-type>] [BITRATE <compare> "<br>"] [FREQ
<compare> "<freq>"] [WMA-FILE] [LOCAL_ONLY]

        The artist name and the song name are, obviously, treated
                the same by the server; confirm this for yourself
                on the windows client.

        max is a number; if it is greater than 100, the server will
                only return 100 results.

        <compare> is one of the following:
                "AT LEAST" "AT BEST" "EQUAL TO"

        <link-type> see 0x02 (client login) for a description

        <br> is a number, in kbps

        <freq> is a sample frequency, in Hz

	LOCAL_ONLY causes the server to only search for files from users on
		the same server rather than all linked servers.

        The windows client filters by ping time inside the client.
                It pretty much has to, and it's easy to see the
                result by setting ping time to at best 100 ms or
                so, and max search terms to 50.  You'll get back
                like 3 results, but the client will still tell you
                that it found "50 results".

        Examples:
                FILENAME CONTAINS "Sneaker Pimps" MAX_RESULTS 75 FILENAME
                         CONTAINS "tesko suicide" BITRATE "AT LEAST" "128"

                MAX_RESULTS 100 FILENAME CONTAINS "Ventolin" LINESPEED
                        "EQUAL TO" 10

201 (0xc9)	search response [SERVER]

	"<filename>" <md5> <size> <bitrate> <frequency> <length> <nick> <ip>
	<link-type> [weight]

	<md5> see secton "MD5"
	<size> is file size in bytes
	<bitrate> is mp3 bit rate in kbps
	<frequency> is sample rate in hz
	<length> is the play length of the mp3 in seconds
	<nick> the person sharing the file
	<ip> is an unsigned long integer representing the ip address of the
		user with this file
	<link-type> see message client login (2) message for a description
	[weight]	a weighting factor to allow the client to sort the
	                list of results.  positive values indicate a "better"
			match, negative values indicate a "worse" match.
			If not present, the weight should be considered to be
			0.

	Example:

	"random band - random song.mp3" 7d733c1e7419674744768db71bff8bcd 2558199 128 44100 159 lefty 3437166285 4

202 (0xca)	end of search response from server [SERVER]

	Format: (empty)

203 (0xcb)	download request [CLIENT]

	Format: <nick> "<filename>"

	client requests to download <filename> from <nick>.  client expects
	to make an outgoing connection to <nick> on their specified data
	port.

	Example:

	mred "C:\Program Files\Napster\generic cowboy song.mp3"

	SEE ALSO: 500 alternate download request

204 (0xcc)	download ack [SERVER]

	<nick> <ip> <port> "<filename>" <md5> <linespeed>

	server sends this message in response to a 203 request.

	<ip> is an unsigned long integer representing the ip address
	<port> is the port <nick> is listening on
	<filename> is the file to retrieve
	<md5> is the md5 sum
	<linespeed> is the user's connection speed (see login(2))

	Example:

	lefty 4877911892 6699 "generic band - generic song.mp3" 10fe9e623b1962da85eea61df7ac1f69 3

205 (0xcd)	private message to/from another user [CLIENT, SERVER]

	<nick> <message>

	note the same type is used for a client sending a msg or recieving one

	[Commentary: this message causes problems if you consider linking
	servers together.  With the current one server situation, the server
	just rewrites the message it receives with the name of the client that
	sent it and passes it to the recipient client.  However, in the case
	where the recipient and sender are not on the same server, there is
	loss of information without encapsulating it.  It would have been
	better to put both the sender and recipient because if the servers
	are ever linked they will have to make a new message type for this
	situation.  -ed]

206 (0xce)	get error [SERVER]

	<nick> "<filename>"

	the server sends this message when the file that the user has
	requested to download is unavailable (such as the user is not logged

	on the hotlist has logged in or out, respectively.

208 (0xd0)	hotlist [CLIENT]

	<user>

	This message is used to send the initial list of hotlist entries
	during the initial login process.  It is normally send prior to
	to the add file (100) commands.  To add more entries to the hotlist
	after the initial list is sent, clients should use the 207 message
	instead.

209 (0xd1)	user signon [SERVER]

	<user> <speed>

	server is notifying client that a user in their hotlist, <user>,
	has signed on the server with link <speed>

210 (0xd2)	user signoff [SERVER]

	<user>

	server is notifying client that a user on their hotlist, <user>, has
	signed off the server.

	this message is also sent by the server when the client attempts to
	browse a nonexistent client.  [why don't they just use 404 for
	this? -ed]

211 (0xd3)	browse a user's files [CLIENT]

	<nick>

	the client sends this message when it wants to get a list of the files
	shared by a specific client

316	client disconnect??? [CLIENT, SERVER]

	client: no data
	server: 0

	The server sends this message with a value of `0' when the client is
	about to be disconnected.

	It is unkonwn what this command does when issued by the client.  The
	server appears to send the 316 message without disconnected the client
	in this case.

	[the server seems to send this message if you send it a numeric
	greater than 1000.  the server will also disconnect you after
	sending this message.  -ed]

320 (0x140)	user ignore list [CLIENT, SERVER]

	client: no data
	server: <count>

	client request to display the list of ignored users.
	server returns the number of users being ignored

321 (0x141)	user ignore list entry [SERVER]

401 (0x191)	part channel [CLIENT, SERVER]

	<channel-name>

	The client sends this command to part a channel.  Server sends this
	message to indicate that the client has parted the channel.  Note
	that this is sometimes sent even when the client has not requested,
	so a client _must_ be prepared to accept it at any time.

	Channel #nosuchchannel does not exist!
	permission denied
	ping failed, blah is not online

405 (0x195)	join acknowledge [SERVER]

	this message is identical to the join (406) message.  the server will
	send the list of users in the channel prior to the client join command
	in this message.  joins that occur after the client has joined will
	be noted by a 406 message.

409 (0x199)	end of channel user list [SERVER]

	sent when joining a channel or a new topic is set.  a client requesting
	topic change also uses this message.

	[why didn't they put a field to indicate WHO changed the topic?  as
	it is now you can only tell that it was changed.  -ed]

420 (0x1a4)	channel ban list [CLIENT, SERVER]

	Format: <channel>

	This command is used by clients to request the list of channel bans,
	and by the server to indicate the end of the channel ban list for
	a channel (also see 421).

421 (0x1a5)	channel ban list entry [SERVER]

	Format: <channel>

425	channel motd (alternate topic (?)) [SERVER]

	Format: <message>

	[The server sends this command when a user joins one of the
	predefined channels.  It seems to send a default message if the
	topic for the channel is the default, otherwise it sends the current
	channel topic.  -ed]

619 (0x26b)	queue limit [CLIENT]

	Format: <nick> "<filename>" <n>

	a client may limit the number of downloads from a particular client.
	once the limit for a particular user has been reached, the uploading
	client can send this message to notify the downloader that they
	have hit the limit and can't have any more simultaneous downloads.
	<nick> is the user who hit the limit, <filename> is the file they
	were trying to download when they hit the limit, and <n> is the
	number of simultaneous downloads allowed.

	Example:

	joebob "C:\MP3\Generic Band - Generic Song.mp3" 3

620 (0x26c)	queue limit [SERVER]

	<nick> "<filename>" <filesize> <digit>

	This message is sent by the server in response to the 619 client
	request, when one user needs to notify another that they have
	reached the maximum allowed simultaneous downloads.  When the server
	recieves the 619 request from the uploading client, it sends the 620
	message to the downloading client.  The only difference in format is
	the addition of the <nick> field in the 620 message which specifies
	the username of the uploading agent which is notifying the
	downloader that the queue is full.

	Example:

	joebob "C:\MP3\Generic Band - Generic Song.mp3" 1234567 3

621 (0x26d)	message of the day [CLIENT, SERVER]

	<text>

	Server: each 621 message contains a single line of text

	Client: client sends a 621 command with no data to request the

	<user> <speed>

626 (0x272)	data port error [CLIENT, SERVER]

	<user>

	When a downloading client detects that the uploader's data port
	is unreachable, it should send a 626 message to the server with
	the nick of the user for which the connection failed.  The server
	then relays the message to the uploader, substituing the
	downloader's nickname in the message.

        <data>    - string,  data to send after connection has been made.

        Listen on <port> for <timeout> seconds. If a connection arrives,
        return <data> to sender.

	Format: 1

	This is sent by the BETA8 client prior to login.  Purpose unknown.

3.  MD5

It looks like the vast majority of the files are hashed using the first
299,008 bytes of the file.  There have been some cases where the hash
matches at 300,032 bytes, but no correlation has been drawn as to when that
happens.  The speculation at this point is that it might have to do with
the existence of a ID3v2 tag, or perhaps the file was sampled at 48kHz...?

The current method seems to be: skip id3v2, seek to frame sync and hash.

Note: the linux nap client (versions 0.7 - 0.9) seem to hash exactly 300,000
bytes, which is NOT what the official windows client does.

More recent Napster clients seem to send the string WMA-FILE as the checksum
instead of the actual hash value for .wma files.

5.  Client-Client Protocol

File transfer occur directly between clients without passing through the
server.  There are four transfer modes, upload, download, firewalled upload,
firewalled download.  The normal method of transfer is that the client
wishing to download a file makes a TCP connection to the client holding the
file on their data port.  However, in the case where the client sharing the
file is behind a firewall, it is necessary for them to "push" the data by
making a TCP connection to the downloader's data port.

5.1  Normal Downloading

Regardless of which mode, the downloading client will first issue either a 
search(200) or browse(211) command to the server.  This returns a list of
files and information on the client sharin the file.  To request a download,
a get(203) request is sent to the server.  The server will respond with
a get ack(204) containing more detailed information.

This is the point at which the different methods diverge.  If the 204 get
ack says that the remote clients data port is 0, you must send a 500 request
to the server requesting that the remote client send the data to you.  In
this case you wait for the remote client to connect to your own data port.

In the case where the sharing client is not firewalled, you make a TCP
connection to the data port specified in the 204 message from the server.
The remote client should accept the connection and immediately send one
ASCII char, `1' (ASCII 49).  Once you read this char, you send a request
for the file you wish to download.  First send the string "GET" in a single
packet, then send
	<mynick> "<filename>" <offset>
where <mynick> is your napster user name, <filename> is the file you wish to
download, and <offset> if the byte offst in the file to begin the transfer
at (if you are downloading for the first time, and not resuming a prior
transfer, you should uses 0 to start at the beginning of the file).

The remote client will then return the file size, or an error message such
as "INVALID REQUEST" or "FILE NOT SHARED".  Note that the file size is not
terminated in any special way, and the best way to figure out the size is to
keep reading until you hit a character that is not a digit (it will usually
be 0xff which is the start of the MP3 frame sync header, but if a ID3v2
tag is present it might look different).  Immediately following the file
size is where the data stream for the file begins.

Once the data transfer is initiated, the downloader should notify the server
that they are downloading a file by sending the 218 message.  Once the
transfer is complete, you send a 219 message to indicate you have finished
the download.  Note that this is cummalitive, so that if you are downloading
multiple files, you send one 218/219 pair for EACH concurrent download--this
is how the server knows how many transfers you have going on.  Likewise,
the uploader should send one 220 messge for each upload, and one 221 when
each upload has finished.

5.2  Firwalled Downloading

As described above, when the file needs to be pushed from a client behind a
firewall, the downloader sends a 500 message to the server.  This causes a
501 message to be sent to the uploader, which is similar to the 204 message
for a normal download.

Once the uploader receives the 501 message from the server, they should make
a TCP connection to the downloader's data port (given in the 501 message).
Upon connection, the downloader's client will sent one byte, the ASCII
character `1'.  The uploader should then send the string "SEND" in a single
packet, and then the information:
	<mynick> "<filename>" <size>
where <mynick> is the uploader's napster user name, <filename> is the file
being sent, and <size> is the size of the file in bytes.

Upon receipt, the downloading client will either send the byte offset at
whcih the transfer should start, or an error message such as
"INVALID REQUEST".  The byte offset should be sent as a single packet
in plain ASCII digits.  Just as with above in section 4.1, a 0 byte offset
indicates the transfer should begin at the start of the file.

Each client should notify the server that they are uploading or downloading
with the 218/219 (downloading) or 220/221 (uploading) command pairs (see
section 4.1 for more detailed information).

5.3 Client to Client Browsing

Napster 2.0 BETA 8 adds a feature which allows direct client-to-client
browsing of file lists.  To request a browse, a client uses the
	640 <nick>
command.  The server then sends a
	640 <requester>
to the client which is getting browsed with the nick of the client that is
requesting the browse.  If the client accepts the browse request, it sends
back a
	641 <requestor>
to the server with the nick of the client requesting the browse.  The
server then sends a
	641 <nick> <ip> <port>
to the requesting client.  In the case of an error, the server will send a 642
command in response to the 640 command.

The browsing client then makes a TCP conection to the remote client's data
port.  After getting the "1" character, the browsing client sends a
	GETLIST
At which point the remote client sends its nick followed by a linefeed (\n)
by itself in a single packet (ie, one write() call)
	<nick> LF
followed by the list of files being shared (the format being the same as
the data of the "share" command).  Each line is terminated by a linefeed char.
At the end of the list, an additional linefeed char is sent and then the
client closes the connection.

In the case that the remote client is firewalled, the browse list will have to
be pushed to the requesting client.  The remote client makes a TCP connection
to the requesting client, then sends
	SENDLIST <nick>\n
followed by the list of files, as with the "GETLIST" command response.

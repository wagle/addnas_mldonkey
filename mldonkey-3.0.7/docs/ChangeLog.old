5666: New option upload_complete_chunks (TripleM)
- default false, if true, each client is allowed to complete only one chunk,
  independent, if it is empty or partial. this setting overrides
  upload_full_chunks and dynamic_upload_lifetime, but is, as a failsafe,
  limited by upload_lifetime (should be set reasonable high)
5664: EDK: Avoid uploading data more than due
      to eMules rotating block requests (pango)
5596: EDK: New option upload_full_chunks (thx to TripleM)
- If the new option upload_full_chunks is set to true, each client is
  allowed to receive one chunk, this setting overrides upload_lifetime.
  Well, not exactly one chunk. eMule has this code in opcode.h:
    #define SESSIONMAXTRANS (PARTSIZE+20*1024) //
    "Try to send complete chunks" always sends this amount of data
  MLdonkey now does the same, if upload_full_chunks is true and client A got
  9728000+20*1024 bytes during the current session its upload slot will be
  revoked unless pending slots are empty.

* Each file is divided into blocks saved in new option
* file_disk_allocation_bitmap in swarmer section of files.ini
* Blocksize is computed like this: file_size / 200, rounded up to full
  megabytes, if bigger than 10MB: 10 MB are used as maximum blocksize.
  Preallocated blocks are marked file_disk_allocation_bitmap option.
* Blocks already fully preallocated on disk are preferred for downloading.
  That way one can get antifragmentation benefits without preallocating
  too much space, specially for downloads with small chunks.
* If the block about to be filled with data for the first time its read/written
  back to disk to allocate the space.
  Set verbosity to "verb" to enable logging of preallocation.

5164: CommonSwarming: Pangos WIP5e'
* When cutting a range, the reciprocal link of the range after the right part
  still references the left part
* When cutting a block in two parts can before empty, but then can also before
  complete (if they have no ranges left)
* Added bad_writes_is_back patch
* When find_range can only find ranges already being downloaded, it now first
  does a quick check to see if there's no other, probably more interesting,
  blocks remaining. If so, it forces a block change (report no more ranges left)
* While it's a good feature in itself, it's probably a workaround for a bug in
  select_block (?); It seems that blocks oversaturated with sources happen way
  too often (4 or 5 sources on a single range shouldn't happen).
* Compute the size of unselected ranges in each blocks, so that sources don't
  "rush" on blocks just left by a source.
* Some BAD WRITEs seems to happen because we forget ranges we requested
  (when switching blocks ?)
* Replaced call to clear_uploader_ranges by a call to clear_uploader_intervals
  in BitTorrent support Choke message handler.

5141: Swarmer: New option swarming_block_selection_algorithm (pango)
* Allow to choose swarmer block selection algorithm at runtime.
  - Algorithm 1 is the current default algorithm

    downloaded chunks, specially with Bittorrent. It was previously
    reverted because of unknown performance problem (slower download ?)

* Add FTP downloads to bandwidth controller (for stats & speed limiter)
* Support FTP sites that do not buffer input (MS FTP)
* Add support for user/pass (http://user:pass@site or ftp://user:pass@site).
  This also adds user/pass support to http_client.
* Error codes from HTTP (ie: 404) and some from FTP are supported (530 sometimes
  signals a retry, sometimes a login failure so a regex was used (lftp)).
  Downloads are paused when a hard error is received (and noted in the log).

5130: CommonSwarming: Pangos WIP4a'
thanks for testing goes to SchAmane, CruX, jave (forgot someone?)
That's a huge patch over CommonSwarming module (whose job is to select what data
to ask from connected sources, and the merging of received data),
I hope I'm not forgetting anything important :
* first, it's a mantainance patch; Lots of code have been reworked for
  readability and compactness (iterators...), functions grouped together,
  sometimes renamed to more descriptive names. Lots of comments have been added,
  including the description of invariants I've found, and a nice ASCII art
  schema of the swarming datastructures ;)
* naming has been made more consistant, to differenciate chunks (from each
  network view) from blocks (internal to swarming), and intervals (list of
  int64 * int64 beggining/end offset pairs)
* Support for bitmaps encoded as strings (AvailableCharBitmap) removed, since
  it's no longer used anywhere; use the more compact AvailableBitv instead
* Removed range_current_begin from ranges, it's enough for a range to have a
  beginning and a end ;)
* Rewrote compute_block_num to have precise preconditions, and algorithm proof
* Added some assertions to better enforce invariants
  (on verification bitmaps, for example)
* Allocation of ranges is now delayed until the very last moment, instead of
  when a chunk starts being downloaded. Main benefit (beside small memory gain)
  is that requests for different ranges sizes can be fulfilled at any time.
* Modified received function so that no BAD WRITE message can happen anymore:
  condition when data that does not start from the beginning of a range is
  correctly detected and data discarded
  (since ranges cannot handle that case anyway)
* Rewrote a much simpler version of present_intervals
* Rewrote block selection algorithm for readability and flexibility; select_block
  simply "folds" over all available blocks, using compare_choices function to
  keep the best available one(s). May need some more CPU (no fast exit)
* Fixed donkey uploaders calls when disconnected
* Reenable the copy of identical chunks between files. Opportunities for copies
  are checked every 5 minutes.
* Made file writing a bit smarter in Unix32 module so that writing zeroed chunks
  (as can happen a lot with chunks copying) on an otherwise sparse temp file
  does not allocate disk space. A bit hackish.

      http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/
      This patch adds support for a "geoip_dat" option.
      It is a simple ocaml translation of just the geoip country lookup code.
      If active, the file is left open and consulted on demand.
      It didn't seem to slow anything down on my slow system.
      Sends the country # to the gui, use latest Sancho version to use it.
      Web: displays country codes in a column (name in tooltip).
      Maybe someone wants to add flag images (please make them optional).

* some log cleaning
* added information to notification email if auto_commit is disabled,
  email is sent by file_completed, not file_commit
* moved execution of !!file_completed_cmd from file_completed
  to file_commit, kept option name for easier upgrading
  this was done because the filename of a downloading file can be
  different than the filename of the committed file if a file
  with the same name as the to be committed file is already in
  incoming. older method did not take this into account at all..
* added environment variables for file_completed_cmd, see description:

    A command that is called when a file is committed, does not work on MinGW.
    Arguments are (kept for compatibility):
    $1 - temp file name, without path
    $2 - file size
    $3 - filename of the committed file
    Also these environment variables can be used (preferred way):
    $TEMPNAME - temp file name, including path
    $FILEID - same as $1
    $FILESIZE - same as $2
    $FILENAME - same as $3
    $FILEHASH - internal hash
    $DURATION - download duration
    $INCOMING - directory used for commit
    $NETWORK - network used for downloading
    $ED2K_HASH - ed2k hash if MD4 is known

  added alpha channel to availability pixbuf.
* bug #14963 : autosize slightly broken
  the tick mark for 'autosize all columns' appears only if all columns are set

  are set to 'fixed' mode.

        * close the gui
        * in HTML interface, check "View searches" tab.

4583: GTK2 mlgui improvement (su_blanc)
Lablgtk-2.6.0 is needed for GTK2 mlgui, it fixes a mem leak with GdkPixbuf.
added:
* razorback stats: click on a file in the downloads tab to display the stats
  (at startup wait for few seconds, the time to download the png files...).
* proxy options for mlgui
* a graph tab: global downloads, global uploads and a view per file
  (downloads and uploads).
modified:
* fix Tray icon as per task #4694
* reduce mem use
* configuration files locations: mlgui and mlim do not need CommonOptions.
  Should not change anything for the users as we check the $HOME variable.

4558: Overnet: several patches (includes and fixes patch #4551) (bogeyman)
* better detection of dead peers
* so we can ping less often
* and can be sure these peers are alive
* use ip:port from received pakets instead from the peer info
* use a weak Hashtbl for known_peers and remove search_known_peers
* we are removing all dead peers, in buckets and prebuckets,
  (do not wonder, if you get less peers left ;o)
* do not send useless "Connect" pakets, Fillbucket really works
* every 30m file searchs were created twice.
There are really less peers than without this patch, maybe i'll have to tweak
how we fill buckets. But for now this works and produce less traffic.

* Changed user agent from "MLdonkey" to "MLDonkey", solves problem
  when downloading files from www.gruk.org and www.srv1000.com
* MLDonkey new recognizes links like ed2k://|serverlist|http://server/file.ext|/
* "servers" command now takes URLs
* if period in web_infos is zero the file is only loaded during core start
  (as requested by the owner of www.gruk.org)
* in all places where a filename or URL for a server.met can be used this
  file can also be compressed with gz/bz2/zip
* automatically replace old default server.met in web_infos
("server.met", 24, 
"http://ocbmaurice.dyndns.org/pl/slist.pl/server.met?download/server-best.met");
  with fake servers free list from gruk.org:
        ("server.met", 0, "http://www.gruk.org/server.met.gz");
* fixed bug which prevented loading Overnet contact.dat file in web_infos

Note: file_sources.ini is never saved, it makes no sense to keep this file.

New options:

* backup_options_format, default "tar.gz", "zip" can also be used

* backup_options_delay, default 0
How often (in hours) should a backup of the ini files be written into old_config.
A value of zero means that a backup is written only when the core shuts down.

* backup_options_generations, default 10
Define the total number of options archives in old_config.

Command save got two new parameters:
* "save all" saves options, sources and creates a ini file backup
* "save backup" speaks for itself;-)

  this directory will be used, this is the same behaviour as before
* on Windows the current directory will always be used,
  this is consistent with eMule
* on other systems $HOME/.mldonkey will be created and used,
  this is consistent with eDonkey, aMule and Unix standards
* if variable MLDONKEY_DIR is used that directory has priority,
  to simulate the behaviour without this patch use:
    export MLDONKEY_DIR="." && ./mlnet

* Fix the sha1new configure-test for FreeBSD.
* I hope, that i fixed problems with linking libiconv for FreeBSD.
* Change the iconv check a bit. Users with unusual locations
should use --with-libiconv-prefix with configure. Still
seems not to work right on FreeBSD.
* Fix sha1new for FreeBSD for sure now.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2005/04/23: spiralvoice (version 2.5.30.9 = tag release-2-5-30-9)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2005/04/13: spiralvoice (version 2.5.30.6 = 2.6pre18, tag release-2-5-30-6)

* Add an headder-file to charsetstubs.c so it compiles on
  certain platforms. This fixes savannah bug #12683.

To compile on FreeBSD and OpenBSD link these files:

/usr/local/include/libcharset.h
/usr/local/include/localcharset.h
/usr/local/include/iconv.h

to /usr/include and /usr/local/lib/libcharset* to /usr/lib.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

2005/04/13: spiralvoice (version 2.5.30.5 = 2.6pre17, tag release-2-5-30-5)

3894: New build targets: release.utils.shared & release.utils.static
3895: Amorphous patches from SVN revision 259
* If using iconv in an libiconv, check for libcharset.h and
use it, if it is not present use localcharset.h . This
should fix compiling on some systems.
* Lower AC_PREREQ to 2.53 (debian wood needs that).
* Some whitespace fixing for configure --help .
* Use -mno-cygwin for cc when --enable-mingw is used. But it
seems like it does not prevent the freezing we know from
cygwin compiled cores.
* Use the present fd for getsize64 in unix32. This should
fix multi-files for bt in win32, as win32 only allows one
fd per file because of the default locking behaviour.
* Ignore exceptions from utimes, as in win32 the default
locking behaviour prevents them.

3896: BT support for file_started_cmd
3901: Change HTML headers from iso-8859-1 to UTF-8
3902: Amorphous patches from SVN revision 264
* Add -mno-cygwin to -ccopt for ocaml. Seems not to fix
--enable-mingw either.
* Clean up canonize_basename, now that we have charset
conversion. Now we should be able to have most chars in
filenames if the locale is set right.
* When shorten-ing names, just use Charset.to_utf8 instead
of String.excaped . Now non-ASCII chars should show up
nicely in web-ui and telnet-ui. The conversion should be
done when these strings enter the core, but that would be
quite a task.
* Remove an Charset.to_locale that shouldn't be there.

3903: Remove some log messages
3904: Format "vd <num>" output in telnet to have md4 hashes back
3905: Prevent crash on start when wrong system date is set
3906: Fix GTK1 GUI compile (was broken since patch 3867)
3907: Fix UTF-8 stuff
3909: Some cosmetical stuff from Amorphous rev 266

3889: Clean logfile
3887: Syncing Savannah CVS with Amorphous SVN
* Applied savannah patch #3867 with small modifications, so
it builds on systems that don't have libiconv but have
iconv() in libc (i hope it still works on systems with
libiconv :) ) and so that the gui protocol version 30
behaves as before.
- new gui protocol version 31 (see guiProto.ml) fixes
savannah bug #11988 : GUI-Protocol doesn't send hashes
for files not from the donkey-network
- fix for savannah bug #12390 : GTK2 GUI configuration
problem
- bt shares now show up under shares
- gtk2-gui: fix some bugs in text display (while using
Pango markup)
- gtk2-gui: fix upload/download rate of clients
- gtk2-gui: md4 is replaced by uids everywhere (downloads,
uploads, results)
* Patch from beedauchon on irc fixes that gnutella and
gnutella2 options had the same prefix.
* Corrected debug-output in http_client.ml form last commit.
* Little debug-log cleanup.
* Fixed savannah bug #12348 gnutella (and related networks)
accumulated more and more ultrapeers (servers) during
runtime and did not forget them, so memory usage growed
over time.

3883: Fix compile errors in GTK1 GUIs due to patch #3867
---------------------------------------------------------------------

2005/04/04: spiralvoice (version 2.5.30-2 = 2.6pre14, tag release-2-5-30-2)

3864: html-interface: slightly easier renaming
3867: bug fixes for the new GTK2 GUI

3873: Syncing Amorphous 2-5-30ac with 2-5-30-1 
* Now really fixed the infinite loop in the sourcemanagement.
* The check for the version of ocaml in the configure file
should be fixed now. Now 3.08.3* and 3.08.2* (for mac only
3.08.2+4 to +8) are recognized. If needed 3.08.3 should be
downloaded correctly.
* Some debug-output cleaning.
* Updated warning message for old mldonkey clients, they
should at least upgrade to 16v.
* Removed option master_server_min_users as it was not used
in the code.

3874: Extend vd command with parameters
* add telnet commands
vd queued
vd downloading
vd paused
shows only chosen downloads
tip: use aliases vdd -> vd downloading
vdq -> vd queued
vdp -> vd paused

3876: Support subrelease in configure.in
3877: Identify more bt peer ids (client software)
3882: Decode http-header-name location case-insensitive
---------------------------------------------------------------------

2005/03/20: spiralvoice (version 2.5.30-1 = 2.6pre13, tag release-2-5-30-1)

This release shares the same code as Amorphous SVN release 2-5-30ab
except the fact is needs Ocaml 3.08.3

3792 : EDK/HTML: More readable uptime in cs
3795 : Updated files for bugs building GTK2 GUI, GTK1 newgui and GTK1 oldgui
* To build GTK1 newgui: ./configure
  To build GTK1 oldgui: ./configure --disable-newgui
  To build GTK2 GUI: ./configure --enable-gtk2
  lablgtk-1.2.7 and lablgtk2-2.4.0 can both be installed at the same time.

3816 : New URLs in FakeCheck. Corrected Bitzi URL
3573 : Allows for aliased commands in driverCommands
3822 : Fix for completed files appear multiple times in upstats
3829 : Options care

3828 : Opennap compiles again
* this does not mean the module actually works;-)

3830 : Review build process
* Ocaml 3.08.3 is now required to build MLDonkey
* Removed config/Makefile.config.i?86.in files. If you want
  to build for an arch that is not the build-machine then
  use for example ./configure --host=i586-pc-linux-gnu .
* Added the opt-binaries from utils to make clean.
* Added configure option --enable-debug .
* Removed the configure options for directconnect and
  audiogalaxy, any developer wo wants to work on them can
  add them again and nobody else should use them.

3791 : Syncing 2.5.30 and Amorphous 2.5.30aa

* Adapted a change to the command "sources" from savannah
  patch #3621 that had a new command "tsources". "sources"
  now prints it's information in a much more compact table.
* Savannah patch #3304 has UTF 8 encoding for strings from
  the core.
* Changed so redirectors (gwebcaches) for gnutella/g2 are
  only contacted once a day. This is no good solution, but
  it should prevent us from harming the network.
* Prevent active_udp_queue in g2 from growing over length
  100 and eating all memory (this is a workaround and
  should be fixed for real someday).
* Now ./configure checks for autoconf259 and autoconf-2.59
  and uses these instead of autoconf. AC_PREREQ in
  configure.in is now set to 2.59 instead of 2.5 .
* The default port for the gift gui is now 0, to disable it,
  because it did not ask for authentication.

      * DonkeyComplexOptions: force use of update_server_list variable, and
          check IP reachability (bug #7200). Should also fix bug #8971.

         good_client_rank option to put clients in "good_sources" queue.
         (bug #9016).
      * DonkeyClient: removed "connection_ok" in query_locations to

  - Bug fixes:
      * CommonSwarming: remove "double the downloaded size" of downloads.
      * DonkeyComplexOptions: prevents saving options before loading them,
          which used to destroy the file_sources.ini and shared_files_new.ini
          files.
      * CommonSources: check_time discarded the real time.
      * DonkeyOvernet: enabling Overnet at runtime wouldn't start it.
      * DonkeyShare: downloaded files should be shared immediatly.
  - Applied patches: #3264 (emule mods)
  - Overnet/Kademlia: added prebuckets. Number of peers limited to 20 per
      bucket and 100 per prebucket. Boot peers addresses from redirector.

2004/08/04: Fabrice (version 2.5.23 = 2.6pre5, tag release-2-5-23)
  - ocaml-3.08 is required to compile now.
  - Overnet and Emule-Kademlia share the same (partial) implementation:
      * Use global options "enable_overnet", "enable_kademlia" and
          "enable_servers" to choose which modes you want to use.
      * See the options for Kademlia and Overnet in donkey.ini.
      * Use kad_ and ov_ prefixes to call commands for these networks
         ("kad_buckets" gives the current connection status, "kad_boots"
           gives the number of known peers to bootstrap, "kad_stats" gives
           the current status of searches, "kad_store" for what is published
           on the client)
      * Currently working:
         * Search for keywords (normal searches)
         * Search for files (localisation of sources)
         * Replies to external searches

2004/08/01: Fabrice

     to fix the implementation of Overnet, and to make it usable for Kademlia.

2004/07/29: Fabrice
  - CommonSwarming: re-implemented chunk duplication.

2004/07/29: Fabrice  (version 2.5.22 = 2.6pre4, tag release-2-5-22)

2004/07/28: Fabrice
  - New subtree src/gtk2 to compile the GUI with gtk2. You need lablgtk2
     installed, and use "./configure --enable-gtk2" to enable. Some things
     are broken, such as availability display (but when is that pixmap
     destroyed ???).
  - New message InterestedInSources in the GUI protocol, to save more
     bandwidth by sending sources information only when asked.

  - GUI protocol:
    * New message InterestedInSources
    * Fields file_all_sources and file_active_sources correct for eDonkey 
       plugin. Should save some bw, mem and cpu in the GUI, when only this
       info needs to be displayed.

2004/06/17: Fabrice
  - Major changes in search results management:
    * New option 'save_results' (default is 0)
        0 : results are not saved between sessions
        1 : results first appearance are saved between sessions
        2 : full results are saved
    * Local search is now always available. A structure to search old
        results (in the same session, and in former sessions if 
        save_results = 2) is built for 5 minutes, so the memory should
        be reclaimed 6 minutes after the last local search.
    * All results for all networks are stored on disk, not in memory.
    * The 's' command output displays a 'N' for new results, i.e. results
        that never appeared before that search.
    * New option 'special_queries' in 'searches.ini' defining 
        abbreviations for search arguments (eg "-movies" means 
         "avi -minsize 650000000 -maxsize 735000000") that can be
        used with 's' and 'ls': "s -movies dvdrip fr"
  - Command 'mem_stats' now takes an argument (0 for normal, 1 for more
       details).
  - Applied patches: #3120 (html), #3124 (ed2khash)
 
2004/06/03: Fabrice

  - DonkeyClient: re-implemented indirect connections that were lost since
      2.5.17

  - Applied patches from Savannah: #3002 (cs_total), #3001 (newgui_csources),
      #2993 (guiprio), #2988 (cs_html), #2983 (typo18),
      #2978 (shorten results), #2975 (title opfile), #2966 (telnet stats),
      #2965 (min users), #2964 (htmlmod), #2963 (lugdu_share), 
      #2942 (emule mod), #2941 (options)
    * #2952 is postponed until I understand if it is already included in the
       Emule better compatibility work done.
    * #2974 is postponed for verification of compatibility with other platforms

2004/05/02: Fabrice
  - Fixed bug causing lost of partially downloaded chunks.
  - Fixed bug in recover_bytes, and added new Edonkey command 
      'recover_bytes <file_num>' to recover files at a byte
      level (i.e. partially downloaded chunks)

2004/05/01: Fabrice
  - Improved Emule compatibility: 
     * Send 'emule_miscoptions1' on Connect, store emule features
     * Receive EmuleCompressedPart messages (if Zlib)
     * Receive SourceExchanges messages version 2
     * Receive QueryFile messages containing QueryChunksReplyReq
     * Send QueryFile messages containing QueryChunksReplyReq
     * Send EmuleRequestSourcesReq even for small files
     * Send QueryChunksReplyReq only if chunks not known
     * Send JoinSlotReq with md4 

2004/04/29: Fabrice
  - DonkeyPandora: print packets and check encoding/decoding of
      Edonkey packets using traces captured by tcpdump and treated
      with Pandora.

2004/04/25: Fabrice (version 2.5.19, tag release-2-5-19)
  - Hardcoded size packet_frame_size to 1 in tcpBufferSocket.ml, so 
     bw-management should be the same as in 2.5.16

2004/04/22: Fabrice
  - Memory leak bug found in the bandwidth management. Udp packets are not
      sent because all the upload bandwidth is used. Partially fixed by
      limiting the size of the queue of packets.

2004/04/20: Fabrice
  - Applied patches from Habi

2004/04/16: Fabrice (version 2.5.18, tag release-2-5-18)
  - Fixed bug solved by patch #2937
  - DonkeyInteractive: new command 'set_brothers' to associate a list of
      files as probably colocated.
  - CommonSources: everything should work now.
 
2004/04/15: Fabrice
  - CommonSources: the implementation seems correct and enough efficient,
      still missing the limitation on the number of sources.
  - CommonSwarming: better handling of the 'last_seen' field

2004/04/11: Fabrice
  - Applied Savannah patches: #2928 (already downloaded), 
       #2861 (useless options), #2852 (typo), #2915 (avoid getpeername),
       #2911 (bt log), #2907 (html prio), #2896 (autoconf), 
       #2872 (voo html), #2871 (clean servers), #2866 (autorel),

2004/04/07: Fabrice
  - DonkeyNeighbours: try to use semantic links to find new sources for
      files among known sources. Send hit-ratio to redirector to gather
      stats.

2004/04/06: Fabrice
  - CommonGlobals: only execute 'do_at_exit' in the main process, not
      in the forked ones (should solve bug #7738).

2004/03/23: Fabrice
  - CommonSwarming: print an error message instead of pausing a file. Still
      to find the origin of the error message.
  - Bandwidth management has changed a bit, but without great success...

2004/03/22: Fabrice
  - Safer options-saving at exit: close all the sockets to prevent "not
     enough file descriptors" error and remove a file called
    "config_files_space.tmp" to free 'config_files_security_space' megabytes
    created at startup.
  - Applied patches from Savannah: #2844(share), #2846(bt)

2004/03/21: Fabrice
  - Applied patches from Savannah: #2832 (telnet_max_name_len),

2004/03/17: Fabrice
  - Applied some patches for Solaris

2004/03/17: Fabrice (version 2.5.17, tag release-2-5-17)
  - TcpBufferedSocket: new option 'copy_read_buffer', every byte downloaded
     from the network is copied twice, so more CPU used, but maybe better 
     network performances.
  - Donkey plugin: code clean-up to use CommonSwarming. Some features are
     now disabled, such as "reliability" until they are implemented in
     CommonSwarming (and so, shared by other plugins).

2004/03/16: Fabrice
  - New function 'CommonFile.recover_bytes' to recover files using non-zero
     bytes interval written in the file. New associated option
     'max_recover_gap' to indicate how many consecutive zeroes in
     the file between non-zero bytes should still be considered as part of
     a downloaded segment.

2004/03/12: Fabrice
  - IP: fixed option 'allow_local_network' 
  - GUI protocol:
      * New GUI protocol 26 with new format for CoreProtocol adding
          the max known opcodes for to_gui and from_gui messages.
      * The GUI can now receives unknown messages without breaking the
          connection.

  - Applied patches #2755 (joinqueuemd4), #2866 (bttt), #2867 (buf_str)


2004/03/06: Fabrice (version 2.5.14, tag release-2-5-14)
  - Http_server: replies are filled in the handler and sent by the server
      (not by the handler anymore). HEAD/GET requests should be treated
      correctly.
  - New URL "http://http_ip:http_port/preview_download?q=file_num" where
     "file_num" is the download number (in telnet for eg). Can be used to
     preview files with mplayer.

2004/03/05: Fabrice
  - New tool "ocamlpp" used for preprocessing files with .mlt extensions.
  - Applied patches: 
      #2640, #2677 (cosmetic patches),
      #2686 (remove array bound error in guiDecoding),
      #2691 (close splash screen), 
      #2694 (status bar in downloads),
      #2710 (default sharing strategy),
      #2720 (mail),
      #2724 (frame height),
      #2726 (bind BT),
      #2727 (options)
  - GUI Protocol:
     * New message: NetworkMessage (network, message) for network-specific
         GUI messages: opcode 63[2 bytes], len[4 bytes], message[len]
     * get_string and buf_string can store strings greater than 65536 bytes
         (when len = 0xffff, there is another 4-bytes integer giving the full
         len)
  - Fixed bug in commonHasher_c.c for files > 2 GB

2004/02/17: Fabrice (version 2.5.13, tag release-2-5-13)
  - Applied patches #2638, #2639
  - New tool "subconv" to easily modify .sub and .srt subtitles files.
  - FileTP:
     * Files are immediatly added, without checking first their size nor
        their existence.
  - Streaming of files for Kiss DP500 Divx player, including
      files from temp/ and incoming/. See the dp500_ options.

2004/02/16: Fabrice (version 2.5.12, tag release-2-5-12)
  - Applied patches #2616, #2617, #2618, #2625, #2626, #2627, #2631,
      #2634, #2637
  - Telnet: 
      * Now, "cancel" does not cancel files, files are just put in a list,
          and you need to type "confirm yes" to definitively cancel them.

2004/02/10: Fabrice (version 2.5.11, tag release-2-5-11)
  - New GUI protocol 24, all times in relative-time.
  - Re-applied patch #2603
  - ./config/configure.in: select former or new implementation of sha1
      depending on the presence of byteswap.h and endian.h.
  - Applied patches #2611, #2612, #2613, #2614 

2004/02/09: Fabrice (version 2.5.10, tag release-2-5-10)
  * Applied patches sha1, #2597, #2603, #2604
  * New GUI messages: 
      Gui -> Core: GetUploaders, GetPending, 
                   GetSearches, (GetSearch search_id),
                   (ConnectClient cid), (DisconnectClient cid)
      Core -> Gui: (Uploaders num_list), (Pending num_list), 
                   (Search search_request)
     GetSearches and GetSearch allow a GUI to query for former searches and
      to receive the results corresponding to a particular former search.
  * New console command "disconnect <client_id>"
  * FileTP:
     * New option 'remote_shells' to define, for each hostname, which 
         remote shell to use and with which arguments (e.g. if you want
         to use rsh or ssh with username@hostname or a particular port).
         still no password allowed...
     * New version of 'get_range' that accepts a 'rangex' argument to
         send the data without base64 encoding (works for me, but I don't 
         know for other shells). Set the 'get_range' option to set the
         path of the remote get_range command, and 'range_arg' to use
         either 'range' or 'rangex'.

2004/02/07: Fabrice (version 2.5.9, tag release-2-5-9)
  * Applied patches #2428, #2595, #2596
  * TcpBufferedSocket: 'exec_command' only creates one TcpBufferedSocket.t
     both for reading and writing.
  * FileTP:
     * Basic "remote shell" protocol (using ssh):
        use 'http <ssh://hostname/relative-filename>' to download the file
        hostname:~/relative-filename. ssh must be able to connect to the
        host without password exchange. The remote host must have the
        'get_range' utility in the PATH of ssh (use "make utils" to
        have 'get_range' compiled with in mldonkey). The transfer rate is
        not very good (30 KB/s, either because of too small 
        tcpBufferedSocket buffers, or because of the base64 encoding).

2004/02/06: Fabrice (version 2.5.8, tag release-2-5-8)
  * FileTP:
     * Basic FTP protocol: 
        use 'http <ftp://url>' and 'mirror <ftp://url>'
     * Option 'mirrors': list of list of interchangeable url prefixes.

2004/02/06: Fabrice (version 2.5.7, tag release-2-5-7)
  * New network 'FileTP' for simple file transfer protocols:
     * Basic HTTP protocol: 
        use 'http <http://url>' to start a download.
        use 'mirror <file_num> <http://url>' to add a mirror.
  * TcpBufferedSocket: initial size of buffer now depends on the last
        read input. might cause problems in memory until a better cache of
        buffers is implemented

2004/02/06: Fabrice (version 2.5.6, tag release-2-5-6)
  * CommonInteractive:
     * file_cancel: removes the file itself
  * Unix32:
     * new function 'destroy' to completely destroy a FD, so that it cannot
        be used afterwards (but it does not remove the file). Used
        in CommonInteractive.file_commit and CommonInteractive.file_cancel.
  * DonkeyInteractive: clients might get stucked if they tried to
      upload a file that has just been committed, since the name is not
      updated anymore in Unix32.rename. We need to remove the former 'file' 
      structure and then add a new one for the shared file, thus disconnecting
      all the former uploaders (knowing them, they will reconnect asap :)).
      To be done.
  * Applied patches #2586, #2587, #2588

2004/02/05: Fabrice (version 2.5.5, tag release-2-5-5)
  * Change in the version numbers, keep only 3 digits :)

2004/02/04: Fabrice (version 2.5.4+8, tag release-2-5-4-8)
  * Bittorrent:
     * New version of uploaders choice.
  * Applied patches #2571, #2579, #2580 (is patch #2578 reversed ?)

2004/02/04: Fabrice (version 2.5.4+7)
  * Bittorent:
     * Fixed upload for seeded files, and probably some other bugs.
  * Telnet interface:
     * ?? display commands per category

2004/02/03: Fabrice (version 2.5.4+6)
  * Applied patches #2556, #2558, #2559, #2561, #2568, #2569, #2571, 
       #2572, #2574
  * TcpBufferedSocket: event CONNECTED is sent the first time a socket
      is available for writting.
  * Newgui:
     * Gui_cdget: Updated some regexps to correctly query IMDB.
  * Bittorrent:
     * BTTracker: the tracker should work. 
     * New internal command "torrents" to list URLs of files in
        torrents/tracked/

2004/02/02: Fabrice (version 2.5.4+5)
  * New Internationnalisation format: short strings are stored for translation
      in ~/.mldonkey/mlnet_strings.$LANG. The new scheme allows easy 
      translation of options descriptions and all other strings used
      after CommonOption. Can also be used to translate the interfaces.
      Unfortunately, this new scheme makes most of the former translations
      obsolete, but most of them have been approximately changed to the
      new format (see distrib/i18n/mlnet_strings.*, copy yours in
      ~/.mldonkey/ to check)

2004/02/01/ Fabrice (version 2.5.4+4)
  * Applied patches #2532 (new-gui), #2535 (INSTALL.txt), #2549 (vers mesg), 
       #2550 (minsize shared)

2004/01/28: Fabrice (version 2.5.4+3)
  * CommonShared:
     Strategies of sharing can be defined in "searches.ini" (recursive or not,
      min file size, extensions). 
     * Predefined strategies:
         [all_files]: recursively all files > 10 KB
         [mp3s]: recursively .mp3 < 10 MB
         [avis]: recursively .avi > 500 MB
         [only_directory]: not recursive, all files > 10 KB
     * Strategy for incoming/ is now [only_directory].
     * Format of "shared_directories" option changed accordingly: new default
        directory shared/ with strategy [all_files].
  * CommonComplexOptions:
     file_state, file_age and file_size are saved for all networks in options.
  * CommonSwarming:
     functions to save and load chunks and present_chunks from options.

2004/01/27: Fabrice
  * TcpBufferedSocket: 
    * Weak form of connection_manager, that should progressively be used to
        better distribute connections among networks.
    * Zlib Compression of connection is now done transparently.
  * Int32ops: removed Int32 operations. int32 should be removed as many times
      as possible to avoid limitations at 4GB. Bittorrent protocol does not
      support files > 4 GB (check new version ?)

2004/01/26: Fabrice
  * CommonSwarming: completely rewritten. No partition anymore. Better
      block choice strategy. More efficient strutures.
  * BTTracker: 
      * new directories in "torrents/":
        * downloads/: .torrent of files being currently downloaded
        * tracked/: .torrent of files being currently tracked (maybe seeded)
        * seeded/: .torrent of files being currently seeded
      * mldonkey command 'compute_torrent' computes a .torrent file for a
        filename and put it in torrents/tracked/. The file is immediatly
        tracked.
      * mldonkey tracker can be accessed:
          http://ip:6881/tracker?info_hash=.... -> for the tracker
          http://ip:6881/filename.torrent -> to download 'filename.torrent'

2004/01/23: Fabrice
  * ed2k_hash: new option -check <size> to compute different hashes on
      a generated file of size <size> KB, to test DiskFile, SparseFile and
      MultiFile implementations. 
  * Unix32:
     * Open ALL files in RW mode by default, and fall back in RO mode in
        case of error. 
     * New format SparseFile completely implemented. 
     * Unix32.rename makes the Unix32.t invalid. Might cause some bugs
        when sharing just committed files (TO CHECK).
  * Options:
     * New EXPERIMENTAL option 'emulate_sparsefiles' in downloads.ini,
        to emulate sparse files on non-sparse filesystems (e.g. FAT).
        Currently only works for Edonkey files, and <preview> and
        <recover_file> won't work for them.

2004/01/16: Fabrice
  * Fixed problem with files.ini when downloading BitTorrent files

2003/12/22: Fabrice
  * make_torrent: 
     * .torrent filename is specified by -torrent

         files according to a .torrent file.
  * Applied pause.patch 

2003/12/17: Fabrice

  * New option 'allow_local_network' to allow connections on the local
     network for debugging purpose.
  * Bittorrent:
      * If 'tracker_port' is not nul, a WEB server is started inside mldonkey
         that is used as a tracker, with url:
                 http://YOUR-IP:<tracker_port>/tracker
      * New option 'shared_torrent_files', a list of pairs:
          torrent_files = [
               ("/test_bt.torrent", "../../one_torrent_file.torrent");
          ]
        where the first string in the pair is the relative url on the 
        tracker web-server http://YOUR-IP:<tracker_port>/test_bt.torrent
        and the second is the filename .torrent on the disk to be served.
      * New option 'tracked_files': a list of the filenames of the .torrent
          files that should be tracked.

     check whether bitprints with tiger-trees are correctly computed:
       ./ed2k_hash.byte -hash bp COPYING 
     gives:
      urn:bitprint:QI3PHA4WVH75CAL72NCNTXZE3SNHU6K3.5URJJG7REVGICNBK5UQBPFGIEO234ZJ3MX2T54I

2003/03/10: Release 2.03, 

  We are forced to release a new stable version a bit earlier than expected,
due to problems with old clients accessing savannah at startup.
  Compared to the 2.02 release, this new release provides:
   * Better Emule compatibility
   * New improved sources management (fewer sources, but better sources)
   * Improved interfaces: 
       * new WEB interface (use html_mods option to use the old one)
       * some colors in terminal (use term_ansi option to disable)
       * new external searches in the GUI

2003/03/10: Simon
  - Fixed 0 upload bug :)

2003/03/06: Simon
  - Debug: new commands 'debug_client <nums>' to see messages exchanged with
      those clients, and 'clear_debug' to clear the debug table.
  - New option '-daemon' and new command 'daemon' to run mldonkey in
      daemon mode.
  - New commands 'log_file <file>' and 'close_log' to log output to a file.
  - New command '! <cmd>' to execute a system command from the interface.
      The <cmd> command must have been defined in the option
      'allowed_commands' as the symbolic name for another command.
      You cannot pass arguments, only those associated with the command
      in 'allowed_commands' are used (default example: df)
  - New multi-user system:
     * Options 'password', 'http_login' and 'http_password' have been
       replaced by one option 'users', that should not be edited manually
       (to reset, remove it completely), since the passwords are encrypted
       in config files.
     * The default user is 'admin'. He should not be removed. He is the
       only one who has the right to add new users. Default password is
       "" (empty)
     * 'auth <user> <password>' is used to change the user in a 
         console/GUI session
     * 'add_user <user> <password>' is used to add a user, or change the
         password associated with it. Only 'admin' is allowed to use this
         command.
     * Searches are now displayed per user. All other views are shared 
         between users.
  - Bug fixes:
     * Bug in GUI proto 7..13, where force param of Download_query was
        sent with bad opcode.
  - Links to the WEB server of savannah have been banned: in web_infos and
      network_update_url. The redirector is temporarily used to provide this
      information.
  - Telnet interface: 
     * ANSI escape sequences: option "term_ansi", command "ansi true/false",
        to activate/disactivate colors on terminal
     * Command "term <width> <height>" for prompt on last line, until I 
        remember how to detect terminal size automatically.
  - New option 'max_concurrent_downloads', and new state Queued for files
      being downloaded. Only the 'max_concurrent_downloads' files with
      highest priority are really being downloaded, other files with
      lower priority are waiting.
  - Limewire/Gnutella:
     * Correctly send the QRT table to ultrapeers
     * Almost able to reply to searches
  - GUI:
     * Upload tab: new button "Add Shared Directory"

  - Applied patches #1219, #1220, #1221, #1222

  - Source Management:
       * Query files every min_reask_delay even when already connected
       * Removed the 2 queues for really bad files
  - Emule compatibility: on disconnect, file queries are stored if 
     a JoinSlot message was sent, and reused if an unrequested AvailableSlot
     message is received (to be tested).
  - Duplication of similar chunks between files (the next step should be
      to only download one of these chunks) tested every 5 minutes

  - Bug fixes:
    * stats should be correctly saved
    * sources above max_sources_per_file should be correctly removed
    * IMPORTANT: JoinSlot message should be sent correctly again at 
       each connection
  - Gui: added a "Scan Ports" command to autodetect core port. Be careful, it
    can trigger intrusion detection softwares ! It is partially asynchronous,
    so that the replies may appear several seconds after the function returned.
 
2003/02/28: Simon (v 2.02-22)
  - eDonkey: respect max_sources_per_file

  - DonkeyGlobals: removed the mldonkey letters in md4
  - Makefile: 'mlim' is compiled only if mldonkey_gui is compiled
  - DonkeyOptions: removed options are back in downloads.ini  

2003/01/08: Simon (tag unstable-2-02-1)
  - Fixed some bugs in new sources management. Seems to works pretty well.
  - For fun: new mldonkey authentification, just to see how long it will take
     to emule devels to break it :)

2003/01/07: Simon
  - ./configure:
     * called automatically by make when needed
     * -enable-im has been removed
     * -enable-devel has been added for development things
  - IM: 
     * Friends, accounts and rooms are packed inside a notebook
     * IRC connects and join channels, but the channel widget is not done
     * The IM widget is available from mldonkey_gui IM menu
     * 'mlim' is mldonkey IM-specific program
  - Donkey:
     * New source management seems to work, not complete yet
     * Upload: fill client buffers depending on the upload rate

2003/01/02: Simon
  - Makefile: simplification and regeneration from config/Makefile.in

2002/12/29: Simon
  - Gui: fixed the display of the number of shared files

2002/12/28: Simon
  - DonkeyServers: 
    * New option 'keep_best_server' (default true) to automatically change
       the server mldonkey remains connected when it finds a better server
    * walker: does not reconnect if already connected to more than
       the maximal number of servers (option 'max_walker_servers' (default 1)).

2002/12/27: Simon
  - Opennap: send shared files to server after connection.

2002/12/26: Simon
  - Options: 
    * new options file 'edonkey.ini' for options specific to eDonkey/Overnet
    * eDonkey specific options moved from 'downloads.ini' to 'edonkey.ini'
  - Direct-Connect: upload works correctly. Need more tests. Maybe add
     different mailing-lists for (mldonkey-dc@, mldonkey-nap@,...)

2002/12/25: Simon
  - New argument -find_port, to search other ports when the ones specified are
      already used. The options are modified accordingly.
  - Option 'allowed_ips': changed are immediatly taken into account for
      the HTTP interface.
  - Major Bug: fixed bug of 100% CPU usage when timeout < 0.0001 and poll used.
  - Direct-Connect: upload of shared list works
  - Makefile: different executables for each network. 
     'mldonkey' -> eDonkey2000 + Overnet
     'mldc' -> Direct-Connect
     'mlgnut' -> Gnutella
     'mlslsk' -> SoulSeek
     'mlnap' -> Open Napster
    and 'mlnet' for all networks

2002/12/24: Simon
  - Test for existence of the GUI before asking or trying to start it

2002/12/23: Simon (tag release-2-02)
  MAJOR BUG FIX:
  - DonkeyClient: fixed a bug preventing download from indirect clients.

2002/12/21: Simon (tag release-2-01-4) 
  - DonkeyOvernet: updated TCP protocol to overnet 0.42
  - Bug fixes:
   * DonkeyOneFile: removed a bug disconnecting from time to time an uploader.
   * DonkeyClient: 
     * verify that clients have received a slot before uploading
     * remove client from upload queue when reconnecting

2002/12/20: Simon
  - Applied patch #812 (KDE Icon set). The old icons can still be used by
     changing the Makefile line : ICONS_CHOICE=big
  - Applied patch #852 (wildcards in black-list)
  - Applied patch #855: correctly sort servers before remove_old_servers
  - Removed some options for Overnet: publish and search for sources
      is now automatic
  - DonkeyOptions: new options:
     ban_queue_jumper (true): if you want to ban clients reasking files too fast
     ban_period (6): how long are they banned
     send_warning_messages (false): send a message when a client is banned
     max_emule_slots (33): percent of upload slots that emule clients can use
       (cannot be set under 25%)


2002/12/19: Simon
  - DonkeyClient: quota limitations:
     * Emule clients can not get more than 1/3 of the upload slots
     * at least one mldonkey client can always enter the queue
  - DonkeyClient: banning mechanism for clients that connect too often
     (don't prevent downloading from them)
  - Gui: 
     * Remove duplicates at end of list

2002/12/18: Simon
  - Multi-column sort should work again.
  - Reverted again the query for all files to a query for one file.

2002/12/18: Simon (tag release-2-01-3)
  - Removed the Credit System. The world is already unfair enough, no need
      to bring a monetary system here. Moreover, it prevents correct downloads
      from other mldonkey clients !
  - Overnet: Applied Norbert Lataille's patch 3.0

2002/12/18: Simon (tag release-2-01-2)
  - MinGW port: should compile and seems to run. Not yet tested enough.
  - DonkeyServers: 
    * Better way to choose the master servers: if a new
      server has 5 times more users or at least 1000 more users than a master
      server, it replaces the master server.
    * Don't remove old servers if we are connected to them !

2002/12/17: Simon
  - Prevent downloading the entire file list at every connection to a friend
  - Added Ip.reachable to remove local network addresses
  - Started port to native Windows via MinGW

2002/12/16: Simon
  - Applied Martin's patch on WEB Realm
  - Added option 'run_as_user' that can be used to change (setuid) the
      priviledges of mldonkey after ports binding.
  - Started implementing upload in Direct-Connect
  - New command 'friends' to print a list of all friends

2002/12/15: Simon
  - Applied Norbert Lataille's patch 2.5 on Overnet publish
  - Applied Andre Hinrichs's patch for better help
  - Applied Pango's patches (20021213b):

     32_xou_web_interface: applied
     34_suxxx_display_chunks_in_telnet: applied
     35_fix_console: applied

2002/12/12: Simon
  - Rewritten remove_old_servers, scheduled every 15 min
     * CommonComplexOptions.servers is an intmap, not a list anymore
     * Delays are printed
     * Black-listed servers are removed immediatly
     * Last Connection is extracted immediatly

2002/12/09: Simon (tag release-2-01)
  - Fabrice should compile and release binaries for 2.01
  - Fixed problem with stats
  - Overnet: added an option for publish (false by default since still in dev)
  - IM: Only Yahoo works
  - A message is sent to old clients only randomly. 

2002/12/08: Simon
  - Applied Overnet publish patch from Norbert LATAILLE
  - The Overnet patch is too aggressive (about 5 kB/s). It really needs to
     be tune.

2002/12/07: Simon
  - Fixed bug in "nu" command (thanks Rudolf Polzer)
  - "reshare" now add new files to upload.

2002/12/06: Simon
  - Applying Pango's patch: 
       01_display_server_banners: banners already appear in GUI console
       02_force_high_id: applied

       17_hide_chunks_being_uploaded: 
       21_fifo_new_sources:
       25_bolder_remove_old_sources:

2002/12/04: Simon
  - Gpattern: fixed bugs introduced by mldonkey :)
  - Gui_servers, Gui_friends: server users list and file sources list are only
      update 1/10 second after selection to avoid flickering.

2002/12/02: Simon
  - Moved some code in the GUI driver to avoid sending many messages when
      GUI use the POLL extension.

2002/12/01: Simon
  - Applets: new directory applets/, containing 3 sub-directories:
     * api: a common C api used by applets to chat with mldonkey on its GUI port
     * kde: a KDE panel applet
     * gnome: a GNOME panel applet
    A lot to be done. I know a bit GTK, not QT ...
    The Client_stats message is not yet completely filled with useful data
    by the core. 

2002/11/20: Simon
  - IM: 
      * Accounts Window, and Toplevel menu to access it
      * Contacts Window works
      * Dialog Window

2002/11/18: Simon
  - Gui_rooms: each opened room has its own users/messages widgets, to avoid
	reprinting all messages when changing of room. Maxence, could you
	look at that and explain me how to destroy a widget when room is
	closed
  - CommonInteractive: raise Not_found when the option doesnot exists
	(no more "option NAME value changed" for non-existing options :)
  - Instant Messaging: Started implementing the interface for instant 
	messaging.

2002/11/17: Simon
  - CommonClient: check MD4 replies from client (inspired from patch #662)
  - DriverMain: track options_version, to be able to update the options
	when a new version of mldonkey is used.

2002/11/16: Simon
  - CommonOptions: added the redirector-generated server list to web_infos,
	and an option to change the redirector. Now, we should probably
	disable auto_update_server by default, since the relocator gives
	a nice server list. Or we should give more weight to new servers
	when trying to connect.

2002/11/15: Simon
  - DonkeyServer: added sending of UDP pings. Check that pings have been
	replied before sending extended search/locate requests.
  - DonkeyClient: changed mldonkey-specific protocol to recognize old
	clients, and send a warning.

2002/11/14: Simon
  - Fixed bug #1701 ?: read at least 1000 bytes before writing stream
	in a file from Limewire. Gnutella clients problem, or is_http_ok is
	not strict enough.
  - Fixed bug #1708 ?: rewritten get_page and wget in net/http_client.ml
	to avoid fd leak.
  - Support #101511: in the Upload panel of the GUI, the contextual menu
	offers to print ed2k links in the Console panel.
  - GuiTypes: new event Server_message_event to send server messages to
	the GUI console.
  - GuiEncoding/GuiDeconding: now, protocol versions will only change when
	the encoding of some old messages changes, not when new messages
	are added, so that new messages can be handled even if an old
	format is used for other messages (old GUIs can benefit from new
	messages)
  - DonkeyOvernet: change the URL in 'ovweb'
  - DonkeyProtoCom: sending much more information to the redirector, so that:
	- we can generate our own server list
	- we can generate an overnet peer list
	- we can gather some statistics on node bandwidth usage to decide
	    when to create supernodes.
  - Observer: now generates a 'servers.met' file every 5 minutes, which is
	sent to savannah, if I find the command :), but the dest is:
	"http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/mldonkey/network/servers.met"
	if you want to add to your web_infos.
	Servers inside are guaranteed alive in the last 5 hours (well,
	unless the redirector is down which is often true :( )

2002/11/13: Simon
  - common/commonOptions.ml: new option "network_update_url" to
	download files "motd.html" and "motd.conf" used to update some
	parameters in all clients. "motd.conf" is displayed in the
	HTML and telnet interfaces, and at startup. Why not in the GUI :) ?
	These URLs are downloaded every day, and can change the configuration
	of the client remotely. This will be used later to test different
	parameters to activate/desactivate ultrapeers behaviors.
  - donkey/donkeyServer.ml: new implementation of remove_old_servers. The
	new implementation sorts the servers, and remove all those that
	exceed their age, but guaranty to let at least "min_left_servers" in
	the list.
  - donkey/donkeySupernode.ml: started implementation of supernodes.
	Supernodes are mldonkey clients, that act as pseudo-servers:
	- they accept queries from mldonkey clients
	- they index files from all clients
  - donkey/donkeyOvernet.ml: fixed bug preventing removal of old
	connected peers.
  - config/configure.in: REQUIRED_LABLGTK=1.2.4 (please, dont force
	people to upgrade if it is not REQUIRED). Use the configure
	script to detect the version and to generate stubs for simple
	modifications (lib/gAutoconf.ml.new.in). Only upgrade for
	major reasons (ocaml release eg).

2002/11/11: Simon
  - config/configure.in: detection of lablgtk version to be able to compile
	without lablgtk-20021031 (must find mouse position, zoggy ??). 
	GToolbox.popup_menu is generated by ./configure from 
	lib/gAutoconf.ml.new.in
  - gpattern/gpattern.ml: using arrays instead of lists. filters directly 
	integrated. Forces many changes in gui/gui*.ml, but should be much
	faster.
  - gui/gui_downloads.ml: Call to remove_client removed until a new message
	is added	for that in the protocol
  - net/udpSocket.ml: implementation of SOCKS 5 support for UDP. Must 
         check that bytes are correctly ordered.

2002/11/10: Simon
  - Fabrice has to move, and his new employer does not allow him to
	program in other open-source projects (for Intellectual Property 
	problems). So he will keep administrating the project (web site, 
	forums, releases), while I'm integrated in the developper team
	as main developper... As a start, I have some bugs to fix, and
	I would like to create a parallel network over edonkey2000 using
	mldonkey supernodes.

2002/11/06: zoggy
  - changes to use lablgtk-20021031 (@#!:@* Why the fuck did you do that ? 
	you are the only developper to use it, nobody can compile now :(
	
2002/11/04: mldonkey
  - Applied patch #634 (increase buffer size for md4 comp.)
            patch #631 (max_connected_servers off by one)
            patch #630 (low id display)
            patch #632 (use DNS in "boot")

2002/10/23: Simon
  - New implementation of 'remove_old_clients'

2002/10/22: mldonkey
  - Patch #576 applied.
  - i18n: 
      * Message files changed: ~/.mldonkey_gui_messages.ini for GUI and
          ~/.mldonkey_messages.ini for core
      * Some messages customizable in core
      * web_common_header, html_header and download_html_header moved
          to ~/.mldonkey_messages.ini
      * ~/.mldonkey_messages.ini can be overwritten MLDONKEY_MESSAGES

2002/10/21: mldonkey
  - lib/options.ml: always close open files. "Too Many Open File" bug again.

2002/10/20: mldonkey
  - New default options for 'web_common_header' and 'html_header' by Xou.
  - Patches #572, #573 and #574 applied.

  - fix: empty results are not accepted anymore (Overnet ?)
  - fix: "ovweb" accepts URLs since default site is down

2002/10/15: mldonkey
  - fix: files should not appear twice anymore in upload panel (files whose
      md4s have been computed replace [are not added anymore to] their
      corresponding temporary shared file).
  - fix: added must_write in udpSocket.ml when bandwidth controler is used
      (UDP packets were not sent anymore...)
  - fix: upload not more than the bandwidth each second

2002/10/14: mldonkey
  - add: internationalisation
      * envirronment variable MLDONKEY_GUI_MESSAGES
  - fix: rewritten upload in edonkey. Old mode can be restaured with option
     'new_upload_system' set to false

2002/10/13: mldonkey
  - add: internationalisation
      * new module lib/gettext.ml for format options
      * new GUI config file gui_messages.ini
      * new directory i18n to store gui_messages.ini.?? files for
         contributed languages

2002/10/12: mldonkey
  - fix: support for several GUIs at the same time
      * Changes in how objects updates are monitored
      * Lots of changes in DriverInterface        

2002/10/11: mldonkey
  - add: 'close_all_sockets' command to close all connection sockets.
      Added to the SIGHUP signal handler.
  - fix: SIGHUP doesn't call network_enable/disable anymore. Bug about
      automatic disabling of edonkey plugin ?
  - fix: new udp bandwidth management
  - add: starting reimplementing multi-gui

2002/10/09: mldonkey
  - add: catch SIGTERM and save the config before exiting
  - add: publication on Overnet has been implemented, but not tested yet.
  - fix: "ovstats" displays more information on current searches

2002/10/08: mldonkey
  - fix: bug in indexer2.ml that prevented complex searches in local history
      and in filters.
  - patch #556 and debian/ from #553 from Goswin von Brederlow. Some problems
      with the end of the patch #553.
      * Availability seen in % of missing chunks, and height in color bar.
      * New "last-seen" and "Age" columns in GUI
      * No segfault on division by zero when size=0
      * No queries for paused files.
      * New debian/ directory
  - GUI protocol 9
  - add: gui open a message box when password is not valid.

2002/10/07: mldonkey
  - fix: "forget_search" should work correctly now
  - fix: use Unix.LargeFile.stat instead of Unix.stat to avoid 
      exception when sharing files greater than 1.7 Go
  - add: filters. Need to enable 'filter_search' option, and to 
      change 'filter_search_delay' (results are gathered during this delay,
      and all filtered together and displayed, so results are displayed
      with this period, and no results are displayed before the delay).

2002/10/06: mldonkey
  - fix: split add_interesting_client in two different functions:
      force_fast_connect_client (connect immediatly, regardless of
       min_reask_delay) and connect_as_soon_as_possible.
  - fix bug #1291: vma does now display all servers
  - add: new command "version"
  - fix: "nu" can take negative arguments to decrease the no-upload period
  - fix: stop adding MD4 to proposed names

2002/10/05: mldonkey
  - fix: clients_lists are now stored in a 5 buckets array, one per minute.
      Strange behavior: the list is almost always full, and the number of fds
      increases dangerously. set client_timeout to 30 or smaller to
      improve that ? Must check that this timeout is changed when the client
      becomes interesting (queued for upload or download). Also set
      max_clients_per_second to more than 5...
  - fix: preferred files are not queried twice anymore, nor client repeatedly
     queried after connection, to avoid Emule Black-list stupid mechanism.
  - fix: unknown commands should print an error now
  - add: new command "priority" that can be used to change the priority of
      a file. Such files will get priority times more bandwidth than
      normal connections.
  - fix: 
     * new command "use_poll" to switch between poll and select.
     * Fixed bug in poll making huge CPU usage
  - add: new messages for publishing files on Overnet.

2002/10/04: mldonkey
  - fix: file_best_name should be used more often
  - fix: recover_temp should use the best available name
  - fix: the number of overnet peers saved in servers.ini is now limited
      by overnet_max_known_peers

2002/10/03: mldonkey
  - add: new files for IP multicast, not used, probably never
  - add: overnet URLs in "ovlink", statistics "ovstats"
  - add: overnet new options to reduce memory usage "overnet_max_search_hits"
      and "overnet_max_waiting_peers"

2002/10/02: mldonkey
  - add: priority of files
     * read power added to TcpBufferedSocket.t for priviledged connections
     * DonkeyTypes.file_priority for priviledged files
     * DonkeyTypes.client_power for priviledged clients

2002/10/01: mldonkey
  - add: more debug output for 'dump_heap'
  - donkeyClients.ml: SourceReq clients are not immediatly added to
     clients_list

2002/09/29: mldonkey
  - fix: bug #1252: servers were added several times in Opennap/DC to each user.
  - fix: ed2k link should appear again in 'download' mail

2002/09/28: mldonkey
  - fix: sources are correctly removed from the GUI locations panel
  - fix: Makefile should correctly compile targets 'static' and 'byte'
  - fix: Add command
       MORECFLAGS="-I patches/ocaml-3.06/ -DHEAP_DUMP" make cdk/heap_c.o
      to compile with "dump_head" command.

2002/09/28: mldonkey
  - fix: incoming connections timeout are now correctly set, and
      connections should be correctly initialized.
  - fix: 
     * With select, you cannot use more than 1024 file descriptors
       (otherwise, it segfaults)
     * Added poll support, that allows to use more than 1024 fds and
        is used by default.
  - fix: better control of the number of used fds
  - add: message in GUI starter about the 'ask_for_gui' option
  - fix: faster sharing of downloaded files (probably present chunks are
     checked first)
  - fix: Ip.valid check for class D addresses
  - add: new option 'verbose_overnet'
  - fix: a file name is changed only if it was the MD4 before.
  - fix: don't query blocks for Paused files

2002/09/27: mldonkey
  - fix: upload improvements
     * names are correctly chosen, and sent to the server
     * all BUFFER_OVERFLOW due to long file lists have been removed
     * after restart, non committed files are still shared.
     * bug fixed when shared file list is too long (shortened message)
     * the size of the ShareReq message directly depends on the space
        available in the server buffer.
     * md4s for downloaded files are never recomputed after commit
  - fix: force download:
     * new contectual menu item "Force Download" in GUI result panel
     * "force_download" should now work well
  - add: core errors are displayed in the GUI console (maybe the last line
     of the console should be displayed in the status bar ?)
  - GUI protocol 7 for "force" argument to Download_query

2002/09/27: zoggy
   - add : web directory to manage source files of generated mldonkey pages
   - change : chat protocol version (-> 1.1) to be able to communicate with
	mlchat from Cameleon

2002/09/25: mldonkey
  - add: new module common/commonDownloads.ml to share the functions used
      in all network where downloads are in one piece.
  - fix: mail, chat and file_completed_cmd are used for all finished downloads
       not only eDonkey (CommonInteractive.file_complete)
  - fix: file_commit now moves the file to incoming/. All networks must now
       use the "commit" function, not only edonkey.
  - fix: try to save the md4 of each file before sharing it.

2002/09/24: mldonkey
  - fix: renewed my passport (6 hours)
  - fix: prevent "BAD BAD BAD" lines from removing good sources. Very Important
     Bug for your downloads.

2002/09/23: mldonkey
  - fix: mldonkey_gui prints a better error message when the hostname couldn't 
      be resolved.
  - fix: the configure script allows ocaml versions with +n extensions.

	 code of the Gui_proto module. And surprise, the code
	 indent is really, really bad, making it still more difficult 
	 to understand...
	 Yet to do : change and memorize the size of the chat notebook,

     don't understand why so many features of the first GUI have been
     removed from the new GUI. Moreover, the object-oriented style makes
     it hard to understand and uggly to program. PLEASE, never put objects

Pre-Release 1.99:
  Complete change of the architecture. mldonkey should now support multiple
   peer-to-peer networks. Currently, download is possible from:

    * Audiogalaxy support: works great (oups, not useful anymore :(
     1) Must set 'enable_audiogalaxy' to true in downloads.ini 
     2) Start mldonkey. It should create 'audiogal.ini'. If you don't have any
        audiogalaxy account, create an account: go on http://localhost:4081/
        (if you are running mldonkey on localhost), and create it.
     3) Stop mldonkey. Edit audiogal.ini. Set the 'login' and 'password' 
         options from your account.
     4) Restart mldonkey. Go on http://localhost:4081/ to choose files to
         download. 

   * LimeWire bridge. works great.
     1) Must set 'enable_limewire' to true in downloads.ini
     2) It should automatically connect to several ultra peers.
     - Recover downloads works

   * Open Napster support. Seems to work.
     1) Must set 'enable_opennap' to true in downloads.ini

   * Direct Connect support. Not working  yet.
     1) Must set 'enable_directconnect' to true in downloads.ini
     2) You can connect to some hubs and search for files. Download
      is not yet working, nor sharing, so that you will probably be
      kicked fast.

  IMPORTANT:
   If you want to test some of these networks, edit the downloads.ini to
   enable them. There are a lot of debugging messages (pipe to /dev/null,
   don't kill the terminal). Most telnet commmands should work, but it is
   not sure. In the GUI, use the File->Settings->GUI->Columns panel and,
   for each type of structure, add the Network column to see in which 
   network a server or a file is located.

  * Improved server implementation (enable_server option). Not working yet.
  * Started implementing freedb bridge. Not working yet.
  * replace Sys.rename with Unix2.rename (to allow cross-device moves)
  * brand new GUI : choice of columns, icons, external chat utility, support
	for custom searches. See file ~/.mldonkey_gui.ini for changing icons
	and keyboard shortcuts. Searches skeletons are defined in the
	searches.ini file in the directory where you launched the mldonkey core.


Release 1.16:
  * Compaction forced every 'compaction_delay' hours (default is 2).
  * File age computed for files smaller than one chunk. Better downloads for
      these files.
  * Servers sending extended search results are remembered, and immediatly
     asked if their files are downloaded.
  * Predicates in Indexer should work in most cases.
  * Fixed #100833: new options 'http_bind_addr', 'gui_bind_addr', 
     'telnet_bind_addr' and 'telnet_bind_addr'.
  * Started implementing 'use_tags', a program to rename mp3s from tags (and
      maybe from freedb, someone interested ?)
  * New option 'propagate_sources' to allow mldonkey to propagate sources
     to other peers. When enabled, send far fewer messages than in 1.15.
  * Fixed #100870: WEB interface can be configured through 'html_header', 
     'web_common_header' and 'vd_reload_delay'
  * GUI buffer size increased. Can be set by 'interface_buffer' in 
     ~/.mldonkey_gui.ini
  * Fixed bug making mldonkey use 100% CPU for long periods.
  * Fixed option name for 'update_server_list'
  * New options 'max_sources_per_file' to limit the number of sources for
    a given file. One source is removed each time a new source is added 
    above this number.
  * New command 'id' to display ID numbers for connected servers.
  * 'client_buffer_size' set to 500000 by default.
  * Fixed bug in ocaml patch that made open_mldonkey never finish downloads.

Release 1.15:
  * Started implementing mldonkey_s (eDonkey compatible server)
  * GUI:
    - Should fit in 640x480 screens.
    - Server can be specified by ip:port in Add Server entry.
    - Removed some non-tailrecursive functions.
  * Core acts now with all (direct) clients as a server to diffuse sources
     for files. Indirect mldonkey clients can also receive information.
  * WEB interface:
    - New option 'customized_searches' that can be used to add new
       queries in the WEB interface (see new option file searches.ini
       for examples).
    - Improved searches (work also in the GTK GUI): 
       * In the keyword/artist/title/album fields, a '-' in front of
        a word means 'without'. Words separated by
        spaces must appear in the reply. 
       * In the format field: you can specify several formats, separated by
        spaces. A '-' in front of a format means you don't want that format.
    - New options 'web_header' and 'web_header_frame' to customize the header
       displayed by the Web interface.
    - Generate correct HTML with HEAD and TITLE :)
    - Downloads can be sorted by name/percent/downloaded/size/rate.
    - Paused downloads are correctly displayed.
    - Use tables instead of spaces (for non-fixed fonts).
    - Added option 'use_html_frames'. When frames are enabled, clicking
       on a result to download will only modify the second frame.
    - Checklist of downloads and results can be activated/desactivated with
      the option 'html_checkbox_file_list'.
    - The number of days since the file was last seen complete is now displayed
  * Core:
    - New option 'file_completed_cmd' for a command which is called when 
     a file download is completed with as arguments: 
     <filename on disk> <md4> <size> <names on the edonkey networks>*
    - Started moving local indexation from mldonkey to an auxiliary program,
     controled by options 'local_index_find_cmd' and 'local_index_add_cmd'.
     See the 'Using auxiliary programs for local indexation' section in
     the help (in progress, doesn't work).
    - New command line option -client_ip that can be used to force the
     IP used by mldonkey (if you have a firewall). Be careful with
     dynamic IPs.
    - Delay between md4 computation can be set by 'compute_md4_delay' option.
     Chunks downloaded improve to reduce long md4 computations.
  * Most problems with ed2k:// links should be fixed (/ at the end, and
     spaces in the middle). MLdonkeySubmit is distributed for Konqueror users.
  * Improved implementation of indexation. Documents description are
     stored on disk. Different choices of indexation.
  * Server black list: 'bs <ip1> <ip2> ...' in console to add IPs to the
    server blacklist. Servers on this black list are eventually removed,
    and will never be added again.
  * New option 'master_server_min_users' that prevent mldonkey from remaining
     connected to a server with too few users.
  * New option 'dont_update_server_list' to disable automatic update of
     server lists.
  * Telnet interface: 
     - New command 'remove_old_servers'
  * New (less-aggressive) management of sources:
     - New option 'max_source_age' (in days) to remove old sources.
     - New option 'max_clients_per_second' to prevent bursts of connections.
  * Faster computation of md4s for i486/i586/i686 Linux systems.
  * Fixed bugs:  
   - #100662: only valid server IPs are accepted.
   - Use IP returned by getsockname instead of the one from gethostbyname.
   - #100761: new option 'update_server_list' to choose whether you want 
     mldonkey to automatically add new servers to your server list.
   - Fixed bug preventing sharing of in-download files after restart.
   - Fixed bug making history.met always increase.

Release 1.14:
  * Bandwidth is now controled by the 'max_hard_download_rate' and
      'max_hard_upload_rate' options. Old rate options are obsolete.
  * All simple options can now be set by arguments on the command line (use 
     -help to show arguments).
  * Bug fixes:
    - Removed non-tailrecursive function in options.ml causing segfault when
       loading files.ini.
    - Connected clients without names in GUI should not appear anymore.
    - Remove 2 minutes timeout for queued clients.

Release 1.13:
  * Annotations on files in file 'comments.met'. Commands 'comments <filename>'
    to load a file, and 'comment <md4> <comment>' to add a new comment.
    Such comments could be downloaded from web sites (sharereactor.com).
  * New option 'web_infos' and new command 'add_url' on console: allow
    to download a file from the WEB automatically everyday (or less 
    frequently). Currently, only server.met and comments.met files are
    supported.
  * GUI:
     - New config file in $HOME/.mldonkey_gui.ini with GUI options
     - colors added in lists (see .mldonkey_gui.ini)
     - Layout is saved.

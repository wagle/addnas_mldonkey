This directory contains some useful files to use Pandora with MLdonkey.

stacks: contains the description of a stack that takes a file
   'trace.dump' and output the trace in a better format, using the
   tcpprint component also provided.

tcpprintcomponent.cc: this component prints the packets as a set of
   calls to ocaml functions.

The output of these components can be used directly by mldonkey.

Example:

1) You have a trace generated by ethereal 'kazaa.dump'. In pandora/src,
do (you need to have replaced the stacks file, and compiled pandora with
the new tcpprintcomponent.cc in pandora/pandora_components/).

cp kazaa.dump trace.dump
./pandora -s separator > kazaa.ml

2) Now, you have a file kazaa.ml, edit it and add at the beginning:

================================ BEGIN ADD
open FasttrackServers;;
open Pandora;;

let _ =
================================= END ADD 

and at the end:
================================ BEGIN ADD
commit ();;
================================= END ADD 

3) Now, execute the file in mldonkey/:

make runtop < kazaa.ml > kazaa.txt

4) This is only possible because src/networks/fasttrack/fasttrackServers.ml
contains a module Pandora, that defines how to print the traces.
You can also use this feature for Gnutella and Gnutella2 traces.
